I've reviewed the banking application's codebase. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. Frontend Structure The `index.html` implements a modern banking UI with:
- Header with navigation and language selection
- Main content area with card privileges, trade offers, and money lock features
- Footer with quick actions and login button
- Floating call button with WebRTC integration
2. Styling The `styles.css` provides:
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom color variables for consistent theming
- Modern UI elements with gradients and animations
- Well-structured component styling
3. WebRTC Integration The `sip-config.js` includes:
- Multiple SBC configurations (Cisco, Ribbon, Oracle, Avaya, FreePBX, Sangoma)
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Audio codec support
- STUN/TURN server configurations
4. Security Concerns Some potential issues to address:
- Hardcoded STUN/TURN credentials in index.html
- Example domains and credentials in sip-config.js
- Need for proper credential management
5. Recommendations
- Implement environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Add error handling for WebRTC connections
- Consider adding loading states for the call interface
- Implement proper SSL/TLS certificate verification
- Add proper WebRTC fallback mechanisms
